## My process

- Start by reviewing the user's instructions and understanding what was required.
- Create a new repository in Github.
- Initialize git, create an HTML file called `index.html`.
- Set up the project structure using HTML5 semantic tags.
- Install and Add Sass in order to preprocess the css into a stylesheet.
- Add CSS stylesheet link to my html document and began writing basic styling.
- Create a responsive layout based on the provided design mock.
- Use media queries to adjust the font size and spacing accordingly.
- For accessibility purposes, I added ARIA roles and labels to each element.
- Add Animation to links.
- Finally, I made sure that the site is fully accessible by testing it with various browsers and devices
